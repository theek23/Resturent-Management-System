Act like proffesional project manager. I want to create project proposal for my project. 1st title of that is "Introduction to business". A summery is below. It needs to be expanded. Grammer is needed correctly. Must be simple. Even 1000 words is not a problem. 

This business is a restaurant. It is located in the Hapugala area in Galle. The main customers here are the Hapugala Engineering Faculty Student. This is a business that has been running for 20 years. The employees here have also been working here for a long time. It was first started as a tea shop. Later food and beverages were also sold here. Now this has become a restaurant. The name registered here is "Dhanuja Cafe". But this is more popularly known as "Bata Kade". The reason for this is the large bamboo tree in front of the shop.

It currently employs about 14 permanent employees. Their main challenge is the traffic that is formed after the end of the lectures of the University Students. Often there is a queue near the shop entrance door. Here the customer has to buy food from the queue for a long time. The current process is to go to the cashier area and order the food and get the food you need again to the waiters.

Besides cooked food, drinks, desserts, biscuits, chocolates, toffees, soaps are also sold here.  Another requirement of theirs is to get daily sales report and store reports.  Also requirements are to manage employees, supplier details and keep details of bills coming to the shop daily.




2st title of that is "Overview of the proposed solution" A summery is below. It needs to be expanded as you can. Grammer is needed correctly. Must be simple.

This is my suggestion to manage the traffic required for this.  Customer comes and orders food or what is needed from the cashier.  Here, the cashier mentions what the customer wants and places the order through the system.  Then the money related to the order is received from the customer and a bill is given.  Meanwhile, after the cashier places the order, the items required for the order are shown on the display in the waiter section.  After placing the order, the waiter or the cashier will complete the order through the system.  When the system completes, the order corresponding to the order id is shown as done on the customer display.  After the order is done, the customer can get the items related to the order.

Also, details about orders, details about items, details about suppliers and every day summery details are saved in a database.









Managing customer traffic and improving the ordering process is a critical aspect of running a successful restaurant. In response to the challenges faced by Dhanuja Cafe, I propose the following solution.

Firstly, customers will place their orders with the cashier, who will enter the order details into the system. The cashier will then receive payment from the customer and provide a bill. Simultaneously, the order will be displayed on a screen in the waiter section, allowing the waitstaff to prepare the order promptly.

Once the order has been prepared, the cashier or waiter will mark it as complete in the system. The customer will be notified via a display that their order is ready for pickup.

The proposed solution also involves keeping detailed records of orders, items, suppliers, and daily summaries. These details will be saved in a database for easy access and analysis.

Implementing this solution will help to streamline the ordering process, reduce wait times, and improve customer satisfaction. With a more efficient system in place, Dhanuja Cafe will be better equipped to handle high traffic volumes and maintain a high level of service quality.

Additionally, the proposed solution includes implementing an employee management system that includes performance evaluations, training, and development programs. This will help to ensure that the staff is well-trained and motivated, resulting in a more productive workforce and a better customer experience.

In conclusion, the proposed solution offers a comprehensive and effective way to manage the customer traffic and improve the overall efficiency of Dhanuja Cafe. By implementing this solution, the cafe can enhance its reputation, attract more customers, and achieve long-term success in the highly competitive restaurant industry.
